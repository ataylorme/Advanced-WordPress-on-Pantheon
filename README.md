# Advanced WordPress on Pantheon

## Purpose
This repository is an example of an advanced WordPress 
deployment workflow on Pantheon integrating tools such as:
* Asset compilation with gulp
* Dependency management with Composer
* Build process on Circle CI
* Quicksilver platform hooks to fire off third party tests
* Slack notification integration

## Circle CI Setup
The following sensitive variables will need to be 
stored in Circle CI as environment variables
* PANTHEON_SITE_UUID
    * The Pantheon UUID of the site to deploy to
* PANTHEON_GIT_URL
    * The SSH URL of the Pantheon Git repository for the above site
* PANTHEON_MACHINE_TOKEN
    * A Pantheon machine token for a user with access to the above repository
* GIT_EMAIL
    * Email address of the account used to make Git commits to the Pantheon repository
* GIT_USERNAME
    * Username of the account used to make Git commits to the Pantheon repository
* GIT_TOKEN
    * A Github token with read access to the source repository
* SLACK_CHANNEL
	* The name of the Slack channel to post messages to
* SLACK_USERNAME
	* The username to post Slack messages with
* SLACK_HOOK_URL
	* The Slack hook URL in the format of `https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
	
## Quicksilver Integration
This repository makes use of Pantheon's [Quicksilver Platform hooks](https://pantheon.io/docs/quicksilver/).
In order to use the Quicksilver integration you need to create a `secrets.json` file, based on the example below, with you API keys and place it in the private directory for each Pantheon environment (dev/test/live).
The private path is located at `wp-content/uploads/private` and can be created/accessed via SFTP. See [this doc](https://pantheon.io/docs/private-paths/) for details.

The Quicksilver integrations included are:
* Slack notifications for code deployment and test/live deployment
* Spotbot visual regression testing
* Backtrac visual regression testing
* WP-CFM import on deployment to test/live
* Loadimpact performance testing


The `icons` directory must also be copied to `wp-content/uploads` on the live environment to provide icons in the Slack notifications.

### Example `secrets.json`
```
{
  "slack_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "spotbot_key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "loadimpact_key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "loadimpact_key_v3": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "backtrac_key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "slack_channel" : "#my-slack-channel",
  "test_url" : "http://test-pantheon-wp-best-practices.pantheonsite.io",
  "live_url" : "http://live-pantheon-wp-best-practices.pantheonsite.io",
  "circle_ci_project" : "username/repo-name",
  "circle_ci_branch" : "master",
  "circle_ci_project" : "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
}
```

## Behat Integration
Behat is installed with tests located in `tests/behat`. [WordHat](https://wordhat.info/) is also installed for your convenience.
Behat tests will only run when code is deployed to the _test_ environment on Pantheon.

## Pantheon integration
Any code pushed to the `master` branch will be built and deployed to the `dev` environment on Pantheon.
When a pull request is created code in the branch will be built and deployed to a multidev environmnent on Pantheon with the name`pr-#` where `#` is the pull request issue number.
Any subsequent code pushed to the branch for an already open pull request will be built and deployed to the existing multidev environment.
Multidev environments for closed pull requests will be deleted on subsequent Circle CI runs.

## Local Setup
In order to develop the site locally a few steps need to be completed. 
These steps only need to be performed once, unless noted. 

* Open a terminal
* Checkout the Git repository
* Enter the Git docroot
* Install Composer if not already installed
* Copy `sample.env` to `.env` and update the values accordingly
* Install Node JS and NPM if not already installed
* Run `./bin/local-build.sh` to install Composer dependencies and compile assets with gulp


## Notes
* `npm install` will need to be ran after any changes to `web/wp-content/themes/twentysixteen-child/package.json` 
* `composer update` will need to be ran after any changes to `composer.json`


### [Kalabox](http://www.kalabox.io/) Setup
Replace `project-name` with you Pantheon site slug.

1. Create a new Pantheon site in Kalabox, selecting the Pantheon site associated with the fully built project.
1. Change directories to `~/Kalabox/project-name`
1. Stop the site with `kbox stop`
1. Remove the `~/Kalabox/project-name/code` directory
1. Git clone this (the external) repository to `~/Kalabox/project-name/code`
1. Edit the `~/Kalabox/project-name/config/nginx/wordpress.conf` Nginx configuration file to serve from `~/Kalabox/project-name/code/web` rather than `~/Kalabox/project-name/code` by changing the line `root /code;` to `root /code/web;`
1. Edit the `~/Kalabox/project-name/kalabox.yml` file changing `php: 56` to `php: 70` and the upstream URL to the external repository, instead of the Pantheon repository
1. Edit the `~/Kalabox/project-name/code/web/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen-child/gulp/browserSyncServe.js` file and replace `https://pantheon-wp-best-practices.kbox.site/` with your Kalabox site URL in the `proxy` option
1. Run `kbox rebuild`
1. Run `kbox restart`

### Local Development
The gulp _watch_ task initates a BrowserSync session and watches for:
* Changes to `web/wp-content/themes/twentysixteen-child/source/css/twentysixteen-child.scss`, recompiling the CSS build files and injecting changes into the browser
* Changes to `web/wp-content/themes/twentysixteen-child/source/js/twentysixteen-child.js`, recompiling the JavaScript build files and reloading the browser
* Changes to `.php` files in the `web/wp-content/themes/twentysixteen-child` directory, reloading the browser

To start the watch task run `gulp watch` from the `web/wp-content/themes/twentysixteen-child` directory.
When you are done developing stop the task with `ctrl + c`.
